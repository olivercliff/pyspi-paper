# Introduction

This repository illustrates how the figures in the paper, ``Unifying pairwise interactions in complex dynamics'' were created.

It contains both precomputed databases with which to recreate the figures, as well as scripts to generate these databases from scratch.
However, given that the toolkit is constantly evolving, reproducing the results from scratch will differ slightly to those reported in the main paper.
